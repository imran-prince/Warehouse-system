                    <Accordion.Header>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work ?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                        JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                        For beginning developers, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text-based format for transmitting data across web applications. It stores information in an easy-to-access manner, both for developers and computers. It can be used as a data format by any programming language and is quickly becoming the preferred syntax for APIs, surpassing XML.

                    <Accordion.Header>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb ?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                        There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data. MongoDB offers an API library that runs within a Nodejs application to give you programmatic access to MongoDB so you can create databases and then add, query, update or delete data from the MongoDB database.
